<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A digital sound source apparatus includes a semiconductor memory connected
     to a central processing unit. The memory has a quantized data storage area
     and a program data storage area. A quantized data train and a stop code
     are stored in a series of addresses in the quantized data storage area, a
     start address is set in a certain address in the program data storage
     area. When the start address is read from the program data storage area,
     the quantized data are sequentially read from the quantized data storage
     area and are sequentially loaded into a data register. When the stop code
     is read from the quantized data storage area, loading of the data into the
     data register is inhibited by a read/write control circuit, the quantized
     data loaded into the data register are converted into an analog sound
     signal by a D/A conversion circuit.

<BR><BR>TECHNICAL FIELD
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to a digital sound source apparatus and an
     external memory cartridge used therefor. More particularly, the present
     invention relates to a digital sound source apparatus in which quantized
     data associated with sounds such as music and a sound effect are stored in
     a memory and an analog sound signal is generated on the basis of the
     quantized data in, for example, a television game set, with an external
     memory cartridge associated therewith.
<BR><BR>PRIOR ART
<BR><BR>A conventional digital sound source apparatus includes a circuit
     configuration as shown in FIG. 7. In FIG. 7, a semiconductor memory
     (hereinafter memory) 4 storing quantized data used to produce sounds is
     connected to a central processing unit I through an address bus 2 and a
     data bus 3. When an analog sound signal is generated by reading the
     quantized data stored in the memory 4 and subjecting the same to
     digital-to-analog conversion, the following processing is carried out.
<BR><BR>In a first step, the CPU 1 applies an address to the memory 4 address data
     in which the first quantized data of a certain sound is stored and at the
     same time, causes a read signal R to assume a high level, to thus read the
     first quantized data and load it into an accumulator 1a. In a second step,
     the CPU 1 generates address data which designates a data register 6 and
     applies the address to an address decoder 5, outputs a write signal W and
     outputs the quantized data loaded into the accumulator 1a onto the data
     bus 3. Responsively, the address decoder 5 decodes the address data,
     detects write signal W and applies a write pulse MT to the data register
     6. As a result, the data register 6 reads the quantized data, and
     temporarily stores it until a next write pulse when quantized data are
     applied. The quantized data stored in the data register 6 is applied to a
     digital/analog (hereafter D/A) conversion circuit 7 and is converted into
     an analog signal to be outputted to, for example, an amplifier circuit
     (not shown).
<BR><BR>Such an operation is performed every time quantized data stored in each of
     addresses in the quantized data storage area of the memory 4 is read.
<BR><BR>According to the prior art, the CPU 1 must sequentially perform operations
     such as (1) addressing of the external memory 4, (2) outputting of a read
     signal, (3) addressing the data register 6, and outputting of a write
     signal so as to read quantized data from a designated address and convert
     the data into an analog signal. Thus a long processing time is required to
     generate a sound. Therefore, the burden on the CPU 1 is large. In
     addition, since the number of program steps for generating a sound is
     high, not only is the program execution time long, but also the required
     storage capacity is increased.
<BR><BR>Moreover, when the digital sound source apparatus is applied to an
     information processing unit for displaying or processing an image as well
     as generating a sound as in a television game set, for example, the CPU 1
     is used for generating music, a sound effect or the like and is also used
     for image display. Accordingly, when the time taken to perform processing
     for generating a sound is long, the capabilities such as a capability to
     display an image is reduced. In order to prevent the capability to display
     an image from being reduced, a method of using a high-speed CPU or a CPU
     dedicated to a sound generating circuit may be considered. In this case,
     however, the cost of the digital sound source apparatus is high. In
     addition, this method is not compatible with previously sold information
     processing units.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>A principal object of the present invention is to provide a digital sound
     source apparatus capable of performing processing for generating a sound
     with fewer steps, thus reducing the burden on the central processing unit.
<BR><BR>Another object of the present invention is to provide an external memory
     cartridge used for such a digital sound source apparatus which is
     detachable from the central processing unit.
<BR><BR>A digital sound source apparatus according to the present invention
     comprises a central processing unit for processing information in a
     digital manner, an address bus as well as a data bus connected to the
     central processing unit, a semiconductor memory connected to the address
     bus and the data bus, temporary storing means as well as write control
     means connected to the data bus, detecting means connected to the address
     bus, and a digital/analog converting means.
<BR><BR>The semiconductor memory comprises a data storage area for storing
     quantized data in a predetermined address space and a data storage area
     storing program data for reading and controlling the quantized data in
     response to access from the central processing unit. In the quantized data
     storage area, a plurality of quantized data for generating a series of
     sounds are stored as a quantized data train, and a stop code is stored in
     the last address of the quantized data train. Start address data for
     designating a start address of the quantized data train is stored in a
     certain address in the program data storage area. The temporary storing
     means temporarily stores quantized data sequentially applied from the data
     bus every time a write signal is applied. The detecting means detects the
     fact that address data applied to the semiconductor memory from the
     central processing unit designates the quantized data storage area. The
     write control means generates a write signal every time an output of the
     detecting means is obtained and applies the same to the temporary storing
     means and stops generation of the write signal when it detects the stop
     code. The digital/analog converting means sequentially converts the
     quantized data temporarily stored in the temporary storing means into an
     analog signal.
<BR><BR>The external memory cartridge is constructed to be detachable from the
     information processing unit which comprises a central processing unit for
     processing information in a digital manner, a first address bus and a
     first data bus respectively connected to the central processing unit, and
     a connector connected to the first address bus and the first data bus. The
     external memory cartridge comprises a semiconductor memory, a printed
     circuit board, temporary storing means, detecting means, write control
     means, and digital/analog converting.
<BR><BR>The semiconductor memory comprises the data storage area for storing
     quantized data in a predetermined address space and a data storage area
     storing program data for reading and controlling quantized data in
     response to access from the central processing unit. In the quantized data
     storage area, a plurality of data for generating a series of sounds are
     stored as quantized data trains, and a stop code is stored in the last
     address of the quantized data trains. Start address data for designating a
     start address of a quantized data train is stored in a certain address in
     the program data storage area. The printed circuit board is constructed to
     be detachable from a connector on the side of the information processing
     unit. A plurality of terminal portions are connected to the first address
     bus and the first data bus when the external memory cartridge is inserted
     into the connector, and a second address bus and a second data bus for
     connecting the first address bus and the first data bus to the
     semiconductor memory through the respective terminal portions are formed
     on the printed circuit board. The temporary storing means is connected to
     the second data bus, and temporarily and sequentially stores quantized
     data applied from the second data bus every time a write signal is
     applied. The detecting means is connected to the second address bus and
     detects address data applied to the semiconductor memory from the central
     processing unit which designates the quantized data storage area. The
     write control means is connected to the second data bus, and applies the
     write signal to the temporary storing means every time an output of the
     detecting means is obtained and stops generation of the write signal when
     it detects the stop code. The digital/analog converting means sequentially
     converts the quantized data temporarily stored in the temporary storing
     means to output an analog signal through the terminal portions on the
     printed circuit board.
<BR><BR>According to the digital sound source apparatus in the present invention, a
     sound can be generated in a digital manner with fewer steps, thereby
     making it possible to reduce the burden on the central processing unit.
<BR><BR>Using the external memory cartridge in the present invention, construction
     of the information processing unit need not be altered, thus making it
     possible to maintain compatibility with an information processing unit
     already on the market.
<BR><BR>The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the
     present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed
     description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the

<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing one embodiment of a digital sound source
     apparatus according to the present invention. In particular, FIG. 1 shows
     the principal components of the sound source apparatus.
<BR><BR>In FIG. 1, a semiconductor memory 14 is connected to a CPU 11 through an
     address bus 12 and a data bus 13. The memory 14 comprises a program data
     storage area 14a and a quantized data storage area 14b, as represented,
     for example, by a memory space of 8000H (H in the last digit indicates a
     hexadecimal notation) to FFFFH on a memory map as in FIG. 2. In the
     quantized data storage area 14b, a plurality of quantized data (X1-Xn-1,
     Y1-Ym-1, . . . ) for generating a series of sounds are stored as a
     plurality of quantized data trains (X, Y, . . . ), and a stop code is
     stored in a last address of each of the quantized data trains (X, Y, . . .
     ). The quantized data is not limited to one obtained by quantizing music
     played by a musical instrument or a human voice and subjecting the same to
     pulse code modulation (PCM). For example, the quantized data may be one
     prepared with a programming method by an input device such as a keyboard.
<BR><BR>The plurality of quantized data trains become data for generating a
     plurality of series of sounds by thus storing the quantized data. If a
     first address (that is, a start address) of a desired quantized data train
     is designated, quantized data are continuously and sequentially read until
     the stop code is detected. To this end, start address data for designating
     a start address of a certain quantized data train (X, Y, or the like) is
     stored in advance in a certain address in the program data storage area
     14a. The address corresponds to a timing when a desired sound
     corresponding to the quantized data train is to be generated. In addition,
     a code which represents silence or no sound and in which all bits are "0"
     is used, for example, as the stop code.
<BR><BR>On the other hand, an address decoder 15 is connected to the address bus
     12. A data register 16, a control register 18 and a read/write control
     circuit 20 are connected to the data bus 13. The address decoder 15 is
     constructed using a decoder capable of detecting an address for
     designating the quantized data storage area 14b. In addition, the address
     decoder 15 applies its detection signal to the read/write control circuit
     20 every time address data for designating a range of the quantized data
     storage area 14b is changed, and applies a write pulse MT to the data
     register 16 when a write signal W is applied. The data register 16 is
     constituted by, for example, D-type flip-flops (abbreviated as "D-FF"
     hereinafter) of 8 bits. The control register 18 is constituted by a D-FF
     of one bit corresponding to a D0 bit.
<BR><BR>The read/write control circuit 20 applies the write pulse WP to the data
     register 16 every time the detection signal representing the range of the
     quantized data storage area 14b is applied from the address decoder 15,
     loads into the register 16 quantized data applied through the data bus 13
     at that time, and stops the generation of the write pulse WP when it
     detects the stop code to inhibit writing into the data register 16. The
     details of the read/write control circuit 20 will be described later with
     reference to FIG. 3.
<BR><BR>A digital/analog conversion circuit 17 is connected to the data register
     16. The D/A conversion circuit 17 subjects the contents stored in the data
     register 16 (quantized data) to D/A conversion and outputs an analog
     signal. If an analog signal corresponding to a quantized data train is
     outputted, one sound is outputted.
<BR><BR>The analog signal is applied to a speaker (not shown) through an amplifier
     (not shown) separately connected to produce a sound.
<BR><BR>The control register 18 is used for temporarily storing data (one bit of
     D0) for switching a first mode (enable; E) in which the quantized data is
     automatically written into the data register 16 as in the present
     embodiment and a second mode (disable; D) in which the CPU 11 designates a
     write address to write quantized data as is done in the prior art.
     However, the control register 18 is not required for applications in which
     switching of modes is unnecessary.
<BR><BR>The address decoder 15, the data register 16, the D/A conversion circuit
     17, the control register 18 and the read/write control circuit 20 may be
     constituted by a one-chip integrated circuit (IC) so as to improve
     production efficiency and facilitate assembly.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 is a detailed diagram showing the read/write control circuit and
     related circuits. The read/write control circuit 20 comprises selectors 21
     and 22, a stop code detecting circuit 23, and an interrupt (IRQ) signal
     generating circuit 24. When a code which represents a silent sound in
     which all bits are "0" is used as the stop code, the stop code is detected
     by circuit 23 which is constituted by a decoder capable of detecting the
     code. The interrupt signal generating circuit 24 is constituted, for
     example, by a D-FF.
<BR><BR>Description is now made of an operation of the present embodiment with
     reference to FIGS. 1 to 3. The CPU 11 generally performs operations other
     than sound generation on the basis of a program set and stored in advance
     in the program data storage area 14a of the memory 14. However, the
     following operation is performed when a digital sound is generated.
<BR><BR>An operation is performed in a mode (a first mode) in which the quantized
     data is written into the data register 16 with one step. At a timing when
     a sound is to be generated, the CPU 11 applies mode designation data (for
     example, D0 bit data in an address of 5010H) to the control register 18
     through the data bus 13 so as to designate an operation mode of the
     read/write control circuit 20 as the first mode, and outputs control
     register designation address data (for example, 5010H to the address bus
     12, thereby to load the mode description data into the control register
     18.
<BR><BR>Thereafter, in order to generate a sound corresponding to a certain
     quantized data train (for example, X), the CPU 11 presets in an address
     counter (not shown) address data (AD1) for designating a start address of
     the quantized data train X which is to be outputted so as to output the
     same to the address bus 12 and at the same time, outputs a read signal R.
     At this time, the address decoder 15 decodes the address data, detects the
     designation of the quantized data storage area 14b (for example, any one
     of addresses in a range of 8000H to BFFFH), and generates one pulse in
     synchronization with a system clock SCK. This pulse is applied to a B
     input terminal of the selector 22. Responsively, the selector 22 applies
     to the data register 16 a signal to an input terminal as a write pulse WP
     because it receives at that time a signal (at a high level) representing
     the first mode from the control register 18.
<BR><BR>On the other hand, the memory 14 outputs the quantized data X1 in response
     to the designation of the start address of the quantized data train X, and
     applies the same to a B input terminal of the selector 21 through the data
     bus 13. At this time, a stop code detection output (at a high level) is
     not applied to the selector 21 from the stop code detection circuit 23.
     Accordingly, the selector 21 selects the quantized data X1 from the B
     input terminal and applies the same to the data register 16. Consequently,
     the data register 16 loads (temporarily stores) the quantized data X1.
     This quantized data X1 is subjected to D/A conversion by the D/A converter
     17 and is outputted as an analog signal.
<BR><BR>Subsequently, the CPU 11 increments an address counter (not shown) to
     generate address data for designating the next quantized data X2, and
     outputs the same to the address bus 12. Responsively, the address decoder
     15 detects the designation of the quantized data storage area 14b and
     outputs one pulse in synchronization with a system clock SCK. This pulse
     is applied as the write pulse WP to the data register 16 through the
     selector 22. At the same time, the quantized data X2 is read from the
     memory 14 and is applied to the B input terminal of the selector 21
     through the data bus 13, to be an input of the data register 16.
     Therefore, the data register 16 loads the quantized data X2.
<BR><BR>Thereafter, in the same manner the write pulse WP is applied to the data
     register 16 every time the address data for designating the quantized data
     storage area 14b is changed by sequentially designating addresses of the
     quantized data train X, and the quantized data as addressed is read, so
     that the quantized data are sequentially stored in the data register 16.
     Thus, the quantized data X1 to Xn sequentially stored in the data register
     16 are subjected to D/A conversion by the D/A converter 17 and are
     outputted as analog signals. A series of quantized data (that is, data in
     the quantized data train X) are outputted as an analog signal, thereby to
     generate sound or music.
<BR><BR>When the CPU 11 designates the last address (ADn+1) of the quantized data
     train X, the stop code is read from the memory 14. This stop code is
     applied to the selector 21 and the stop code detecting circuit 23 through
     the data bus 13. At this time, in the same manner as the above described
     operation, the address decoder 15 generates one pulse and the selector 22
     outputs the write pulse WP. Accordingly, the data register 16 loads the
     stop code. The stop code detecting circuit 23 detects the stop code in
     response to reading of the stop code and applies an output at a high level
     to the selector 21. Therefore, the selector 21 thereafter applies data
     from an A input terminal to the data register 16. Consequently, the stop
     code (data in which all bits are "0") continues to be loaded into the data
     register 16 while circulating through the data register 16 and the
     selector 21. As a result, the D/A conversion circuit 17 continuously
     outputs analog signals at a zero level, resulting in a silent state.
<BR><BR>At the same time, the interrupt signal generating circuit 24 generates an
     interrupt (IRQ) signal in response to application of the output at a high
     level from the stop code detecting circuit 23 and the clock pulse from the
     selector 22, and continues to generate the IRQ signal until the stop code
     detecting circuit 23 detects data other than the stop code and brings its
     output into a low level.
<BR><BR>On the other hand, the CPU 11 generates an address (for example, 5010H-R)
     for designating reading of an interrupt signal at a timing when the
     presence or absence of the interrupt signal is to be detected on the basis
     of program processing. Responsively, the address decoder 15 generates a
     signal designating reading of an interrupt signal to open a gate circuit
     25. Accordingly, the gate circuit 25 outputs the IRQ signal to the data
     bus 13. As is obvious from the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, when the IRQ
     signal is directly applied to the CPU 11 without passing through the data
     bus 13, the gate circuit 25 is not required.
<BR><BR>Furthermore, when a sound is generated on the basis of the quantized data
     Y1 to Ym in the quantized data train Y, the CPU 11 designates a start
     address (An+1) and then, sequentially increments the address to (An+2) to
     Am, thereby to perform the same operation. However, setting of the mode in
     which the CPU 11 writes each quantized data into the data register 16 with
     one step is not required provided that the mode once set does not need to
     be changed.
<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 is so constructed as to allow
     switching between the first mode in which the CPU 11 writes each quantized
     data into the data register 16 with one step and the mode (second mode) in
     which the CPU 11 writes each quantized data into the data register 16 with
     two steps in the same manner as the prior art shown in FIG. 7 so as to
     also allow a sound to be generated in the conventional system shown in
     FIG. 7. Description is now made of an operation in the second mode in
     which quantized data is written with two steps.
<BR><BR>In the second mode, data for designating the second mode (for example,
     logical "0") is set in a D0 bit of an address (for example, 5010H)
     corresponding to the control register 18. The CPU 11 designates the
     address 5010H prior to reading of quantized data and loads in advance
     second mode designation data into the control register 18. In this case,
     the control register 18 does not output an enable signal (that is, outputs
     a disable signal at a low level), so that the selector 22 is disabled.
     Consequently, even if data which represents a silent sound and in which
     all bits are "0" (corresponding to the stop code) is read from the memory
     14, the interrupt signal generating circuit 24 does not generate an IRQ
     signal.
<BR><BR>When the second mode is used in which each quantized data is written into
     the data register 16 with two steps, read address data, and write address
     data for designating writing into the data register 16 of quantized data
     are programmed in the program data storage area 14a with two steps, and no
     stop code is programmed at the end of each quantized data train in the
     quantized data storage area 14b. The CPU 11 designates an address storing
     the read address data of certain quantized data in the first step, thereby
     to read the quantized data from the address and load the same into an
     accumulator (not shown).
<BR><BR>Thereafter, the CPU 11 outputs address data (5011H-W) for designating
     writing into the data register 16 in the second step. This address data is
     detected by the address decoder 15, and the address decoder 15 applies a
     decode output to the A input terminal of the selector 22. The selector 22
     generates a write pulse WP at every time when an input signal is applied
     to the A input terminal and applies the same to the data register 16.
     Therefore, quantized data is read form the memory 14 to be applied to the
     selector 21 through the data bus 13. The selector 21 selects the quantized
     data applied to the B input terminal and applies the same to the data
     register 16. Accordingly, the data register 16 loads this quantized data.
<BR><BR>The above described operation of writing quantized data to the data
     register 16 with two steps is performed for each quantized data. An
     operation of the D/A conversion circuit 17 is the same as that in the
     first mode in which quantized data is written with one step and hence,
     description thereof is omitted.
<BR><BR>Meanwhile, on the program design, when the present invention is used for
     applications in which the same second mode as that in the prior art is not
     required, no mode switching circuit using the control register 18 and
     setting of program data for switching modes are required.
<BR><BR>Referring now to the following tables 1 and 2 and FIGS. 4 and 5, a
     description is presented as to reasons why the burden on the CPU 11 in the
     first mode can be reduced, as compared with that in the second mode.

</PRE>
<BR><BR>The table 1 and FIG. 4 show the operation in the first mode, and the table
     2 and FIG. 5 show the operation in the second mode.
<BR><BR>Consider a case where one sound is expressed by five quantized data, as
     shown in table 1. In the first mode, quantized data X1 to X5 are
     sequentially stored as operands in addresses AD1 to AD5, and a stop code
     (STPC) is stored in an address AD6 just behind the addresses AD1 to AD5.
     In the second mode, quantized data X1 to X5 and data R-AD for designating
     writing into the data register are alternately stored as operands
     sequentially in addresses AD1 to AD10. In this case, an instruction word
     "LDA" indicates a read instruction of data, and an instruction word "STA"
     indicates a load instruction into the data register. In the example as
     shown, one step is carried out in four cycles of a machine clock.
<BR><BR>Comparison between FIGS. 4 and 5 indicates the following. In the first
     mode, the read address is designated in the first half of a one step
     period (four cycles), and the quantized data is read and at the same time,
     is written into the data register 16 in the second half thereof. On the
     other hand, in the second mode, the read address is designated in the
     first half of an odd step period and the quantized data loaded into the
     accumulator is written in the second half thereof, and a write address is
     designated in the first half of an even step period and the quantized data
     loaded into the accumulator is read and at the same time, is written into
     the data register 16 in the second half thereof.
<BR><BR>Consequently, in the first mode according to the present embodiments, the
     number of program steps may be approximately one-half that in the
     conventional system, that is, in the second mode. Accordingly, processing
     time required to generate a sound can be reduced to approximately half,
     thereby making it possible to significantly reduce the burden on the CPU
     11. In addition, if the burden on the CPU 11 is thus reduced, the CPU 11
     can be utilized for other processing. In addition, the first mode has the
     advantage that since the number of program steps can be reduced, time and
     labor required to develop a program can be reduced. Such an effort or
     advantage is very efficient in an information processing unit so adapted
     as to simultaneously carry out control for image display and processing
     for generating a sound in, for example, a television game set. Description
     is now made of a case where the present invention is applied to a
     television game set.
<BR><BR>FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing another embodiment of the present
     invention, particularly showing a main unit of a television game set 30 to
     which the present invention is applied and an external memory cartridge 40
     which characterizes the embodiment.
<BR><BR>In FIG. 6, the main unit of the television game set 30 comprises a CPU 11',
     and the CPU 11' comprises an analog sound source circuit 11. The analog
     sound source circuit 11 a comprises four types of sound generators for
     generating two types of square waves, a triangular wave and a sine wave.
     An output of the analog sound source circuit 11a is provided as a first
     analog signal, and is introduced into the external memory cartridge 40 as
     described later through an edge connector 31.
<BR><BR>On the other hand, an edge connector 31 is connected to the CPU 11' through
     a first address bus 12 and a first data bus 13. A picture processing unit
     (abbreviated as "PPU" hereinafter) 34 is connected to the edge connector
     31 through an address bus 32 for image processing and a data bus 33 for
     image processing. The PPU 34 generates dot data which is synchronized with
     the scanning of a scan type display on the basis of character data applied
     from a character memory 46 as described later and outputs the same as an
     image signal under the control of the CPU 11', which uses the technique
     disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No.
     11814/1984 (corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 4,824,106).
<BR><BR>The external memory cartridge 40 is constructed to be detachable from the
     edge connector 3 1, and comprises a printed circuit board 41 having a
     plurality of terminals electrically connected to the main unit when it is
     loaded on the edge connector 31. A second address bus 42 connected to the
     first address bus 12, a second data bus 43 connected to the first data bus
     13, an address bus 44 connected to the PPU address bus 32, and a data bus
     45 connected to the PPU data bus 33 are respectively formed on the printed
     circuit board 41. A memory 14', an address decoder 15, a data register 16,
     a control register 18, and/or a read/write control circuit 20 are
     respectively connected to the second address bus 42 and/or the second data
     bus 43, as in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1. The character memory 46 is
     connected to the address bus 44 and the data bus 45.
<BR><BR>The memory 14' comprises a program data storage area 14a' and a quantized
     data storage area 14. Quantized data used for a digital sound source is
     stored in the quantized data storage area 14b as in the embodiment shown
     in FIG. 1. Data for generating a sound in an analog manner by the analog
     sound source circuit 11a is stored in addition to program data for
     controlling the PPU 34 to display an image in the program data storage
     area 14a'. For example, the program data storage area 14a' stores sound
     type data for designating the selection of any one of the four types of
     sound generators or a combination of the sound generators, and data on a
     frequency, a waveform or the like for designating a musical interval or a
     tone. If the data for an analog sound source are not only stored
     individually but also programmed so that they can be outputted in
     synchronization with quantized data, two series of sounds for an analog
     sound source and a digital sound source can be generated in combination,
     so that a varied sound can be generated, which is effective as a sound
     effect. In addition, program data for returning to the original operation
     for image display when an IRQ signal is applied can be also set and stored
     in the program data storage area 14a'.
<BR><BR>In order to output a second analog signal which is an output of the D/A
     conversion circuit 17 in combination with a first analog signal which is
     an output of the sound source circuit 11a, a conductive pattern from an
     output end of the D/A conversion circuit 17 is formed so as to extend to a
     terminal 48a on an edge portion of the printed circuit board 41 through a
     resistor 47a. In addition, a conductive pattern formed through a terminal
     48b at a position corresponding to an output line of the first analog
     signal from the analog sound source circuit 11 a and a resistor 47b is
     connected to the terminal 48a. Consequently, the first analog signal and
     the second analog signal are combined with each other on the printed
     circuit board 4 and then, is derived from the television game set 30
     through the edge connector 31. Meanwhile, operations of the address
     decoder 15, the data register 16, the D/A conversion circuit 17, the
     control register 18, and the read/write control circuit 20 in the present
     embodiment are the same as those in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 and
     hence, description thereof is omitted.
<BR><BR>The construction of the embodiment shown in FIG. 6 has the advantage that a
     digital sound source can be added on the side of the external memory
     cartridge 40 without altering a circuit configuration of the existing
     television game set 30, thereby to make it possible to achieve a sound
     source which varies in tone and the type of sounds while maintaining
     compatibility with the existing television game set 30. Therefore, it is
     possible to also generate language, complicated music, and a sound like
     synthesizer by the combination with a digital sound which cannot be
     generated by the conventional television game set.
<BR><BR>Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in
     detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration
     and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit
