<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A T.V. game system for displaying a desired picture on the screen of a
     raster scanning type T.V. set includes a motion picture pattern generator,
     a still picture pattern generator, a central processing unit for
     controlling the overall operation of the system under the control of the
     operator, and a picture processing unit for combining motion and still
     picture patterns to form a video signal to be supplied to the T.V. set,
     whereby the picture processing unit includes a motion picture attribute
     table memory which stores information relating to motion picture pattern
     for the next following frame during the horizontal blanking period and a
     temporary memory which stores information relating to motion picture
     pattern to be displayed in the next following line by accessing the motion
     picture attribute table memory during the scanning of current line.

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>This invention generally relates to image processing technology for
     combining two or more picture patterns into a single picture frame for
     display on a picture tube such as a T.V. set, and particularly to an image
     processing system for displaying a picture frame by combining a motion
     picture pattern, which may be varied under the control of the operator,
     with a still picture pattern which defines the background of picture
     frame. More specifically, the present invention relates to a T.V. game
     system in which motion picture information and still picture information
     are controlled independently from each other and they are combined into a
     series of frames which are then displayed on the T.V. screen.
<BR><BR>2. Description of the Prior Art
<BR><BR>FIG. 1a shows a prior art T.V. game system which includes a picture
     processing unit (hereinafter, also referred to as "PPU") 1 which comprises
     a random access memory (hereinafter, also referred to as "RAM") and is
     connected to a video memory 2 and to a central processing unit
     (hereinafter, also referred to as "CPU") 3, which, in turn, is connected
     to a main memory 4. In the system of FIG. 1a, under the control of CPU 3,
     motion and still picture data are transferred from the main memory 4 to
     the video memory 2 to be stored therein temporarily, and then the PPU 1
     receives appropriate data from the video memory 2 and to supply an output
     as a video signal to a T.V. set (not shown) for display under the control
     of the CPU 3. A memory map contained in the video memory 2 is shown in
     FIG. 1b, and, as shown, the memory map includes a motion picture character
     pattern generating area 2-1, a motion picture attribute table 2-2 which is
     rewritten for each frame to be displayed during the vertical blanking
     period, a still picture character pattern generating area 2-3, a still
     picture character pattern name table 2-4 and a still picture color table
     2-5.
<BR><BR>Described the operation of the above-described system with reference to
     FIG. 2, during the horizontal blanking period in carrying out scanning
     along horizontal line sectors, the motion picture attribute table 2-2 is
     accessed under the control of the operator thereby retrieving the
     attributes of motion picture pattern to be displayed in the next scanning
     line. Then, on the basis of the thus retrieved attributes, desired motion
     picture character pattern data is outputted from the motion character
     pattern generating area 2-1 during the same horizontal blanking period
     thereby generating a motion picture pattern. On the other hand, as the
     line scanning of the display screen proceeds, a pattern name and a color
     code are read out from the addresses, which corresponds to a display
     position, of still picture character pattern name table 2-4 and the still
     picture color table 2-5, respectively. On the basis of the pattern name
     thus read out, a pattern data is outputted from the still picture
     character pattern generating area 2-3 so that a still picture pattern is
     generated in real time. If there occurs a collision between the still
     picture pattern data and the motion picture pattern data at the same
     position on the display screen, either one of them is allowed to be
     displayed in accordance with a predetermined priority.
<BR><BR>In the above-described prior art system, since external address and data
     buses are used to call and obtain still picture character data during the
     line scanning period and also the number of pins usable for
     interconnections between components is limited, the retrieving of the
     motion picture attribute table and the calling of motion picture character
     pattern data on the basis of the result of such retrieval must all be
     carried out during the horizontal blanking period. For this reason, the
     number of motion picture characters which may be displayed during a single
     line scanning period is rather limited so is the kind of motion picture
     characters which may be displayed in a single frame. As a result,
     displayed pictures tend to be dull and they do not change as fast as
     pleasing to a viewer.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to obviate the
     above described disadvantages of the prior art and to provide an improved
     image processing system.
<BR><BR>Another object of the present invention is to provide an image processing
     system which is suitable for application as a T.V. game system.
<BR><BR>A further object of the present invention is to provide an image processing
     system capable of displaying the increased number and kinds of moving
     characters without increasing the number of pins when constructed in the
     form of ICs.
<BR><BR>A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved
     color encoder particularly suited for use in a T.V. game system.
<BR><BR>A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved
     T.V. game system.
<BR><BR>Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will
     become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention
     when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the image processing system constructed
     when applied as a T.V. game system in accordance with one embodiment of
     the present invention. As shown, the present image processing system or
     T.V. game system includes a picture processing unit ("PPU") 11 provided
     with a motion picture attribute table memory 12-2 which is typically
     comprised of a RAM and which is rewritten for each frame with the
     information supplied from the video memory, as different from PPU 1 of the
     prior art system shown in FIG. 1a. PPU 11 also includes a temporary memory
     15 which is also typically comprised of a RAM. The temporary memory 15
     stores the motion picture character data for a single scanning line by
     retrieving the motion picture attribute table memory 12-2 and it is
     rewritten for each scanning line. Also provided in PPU 11 is a motion
     picture buffer memory 16 which is typically comprised of a RAM whose
     contents are rewritten for each scanning line and which stores the
     attributes and pattern data of the motion picture character stored in the
     temporary memory 15. PPU 11 further includes a synthesizer 17 which is
     connected to receive an output signal from the motion picture buffer
     memory 16 and an output signal from a still picture character pattern
     generator 12-3 or an output signal supplied from an external circuit, as
     the case may be, to supply a particular signal, which is a combination of
     two or more input signals, as its output in accordance with predetermined
     conditions.
<BR><BR>A video memory 12 is provided external to PPU 11 and it includes a motion
     picture character pattern generator 12-1, a still picture character
     pattern generator 12-3 typically comprised of a ROM or RAM, four still
     picture character pattern name tables 12-41 through 12-44 typically
     comprised of RAMs and four still picture color tables 12-51 through 12-54
     typically comprised of RAMs. As shown in FIG. 3, PPU 11 is also connected
     to CPU 3 which controls the overall operation of the present system and
     which is connected to a main memory 4.
<BR><BR>In operation, when a main switch (not shown) is turned on or programs
     containing different games are changed, the contents of the still picture
     character pattern name tables 12-41 through 12-44 and still picture color
     tables 12-51 through 12-54 are rewritten in accordance with the main
     memory 4 under the control of CPU 3. Then, at the first vertical blanking
     period of a single frame, the contents of the motion picture attribute
     table memory 12-2 are also rewritten in accordance with the main memory 4
     under the control of CPU 3.
<BR><BR>In PPU 11, during line scanning, the motion picture character pattern to be
     displayed in the next scanning line is retrieved from the motion picture
     attribute table memory 12-2 and stored into the temporary memory 15, and,
     then, during the horizontal blanking period, the motion picture character
     pattern generator 12-1 is retrieved on the basis of the data then stored
     in the temporary memory 15 via address and data buses, thereby causing the
     data necessary to display a motion picture character for the next line to
     be stored into the motion picture buffer memory 16. After initiation of
     line scanning, when the corresponding horizontal position has been
     reached, the motion picture character pattern data is supplied to the
     synthesizer 17 from the motion picture buffer memory 16, and at the same
     time the still picture character pattern name tables 12-41 through 12-44
     and the color tables 12-51 through 12-54 are retrieved in real time via
     address and data buses so that the still picture character pattern data
     thus retrieved and defining the background of a displayed picture is
     supplied from the still picture character pattern generator 12-3 to the
     synthesizer 17.
<BR><BR>In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the still picture character
     pattern name tables 12-41 through 12-44 and the still picture color tables
     12-51 through 12-54 are larger in area by four times than the display area
     or screen. Accordingly, a desired still picture may be displayed on the
     display screen by using only one of the four still picture character
     pattern name tables, or, alternatively, the display area may be set at any
     location within the scope of four frames to define a desired background to
     be displayed on the screen as shown in FIGS. 4a and 4b. The display area
     may be shifted horizontally as well as vertically independently from each
     other in a scrolling fashion with a dot as a unit. Such a scrolling
     technique is disclosed, for example, in the Japanese Patent Laid-open Pub.
     No. 55-96186.
<BR><BR>It is to be noted that in the video memory 12 the motion picture character
     pattern generator 12-1 and the still picture character pattern generator
     12-3 may not only be used separately from each other as described above
     but also be used in common. That is, the same character pattern generator
     may be accessed by an address for motion picture and another address for
     still picture thereby producing both of motion picture and still picture
     characters from the same character pattern generator. Such a structure is
     advantageous because an increased number of characters may be generated
     using a character pattern generator of the same capacity as compared with
     the case in which a character pattern generator is not used in common.
<BR><BR>An assumption is made here that the display area or screen has the width of
     256 dots in the horizontal direction and the height of 240 dots in the
     vertical direction and a character constituting a motion picture or still
     picture is defined by a matrix of 8 dots by 8 dots. It is also assumed
     that the max. number of motion pictures to be displayed on a single
     horizontal line is eight and thus 64 motion pictures may be displayed on
     the screen at maximum at the same time. Furthermore, in the motion picture
     character pattern generator 12-1 and the still picture character pattern
     generator 12-3, a single dot or picture element to be displayed on the
     screen is represented by two bits and thus a single character formed by 8
     dots by 8 dots is represented by 16 bytes.
<BR><BR>FIG. 5 shows the detailed structure of PPU 11 shown in FIG. 3. Now, it will
     first be described as to the structure for displaying a motion picture
     character pattern. The motion picture attribute table memory 12-2 for
     storing the attributes of motion picture characters for a single frame has
     a capacity to store sixty-four motion picture characters as shown in FIG.
     6 and it has areas for storing a vertical position (8 bits), a character
     number (8 bits), an attribute (5 bits) and a horizontal position (8 bits)
     for each character to be displayed. The attribute data includes 1 bit for
     each of horizontal and vertical inversions, 1 bit for determining the
     priority between motion and still picture characters and 2 bits for color
     display.
<BR><BR>Storage of data from CPU 3 into the motion picture attribute table 12-2 is
     carried out via input terminals D.sub.0-7 and its storage position is
     determined by a motion picture attribute memory address register 18. While
     the previous line is being scanned, the retrieval of the motion picture
     character to be displayed on the next following line is carried out by a
     comparator 20 using a vertical position data. At the comparator 20, the
     signal indicating the vertical position of the next line to be displayed
     is compared with the vertical position data of each character stored in
     the motion picture attribute table memory 12-2 to determine whether they
     agree (in-range) or not. The motion picture character which has been found
     to be in-range is then stored into the temporary memory 15 by means of a
     temporary memory register 19. The temporary memory 15 is provided with an
     area capable of storing eight motion picture characters at the same time.
     Accordingly, if nine or more motion picture characters have been found to
     be in-range, only eight of them are stored into the temporary memory 15
     with a flag indicating the presence of nine or more being posted.
<BR><BR>The motion picture buffer memory 16 whose contents are rewritten during the
     horizontal blanking period also has the memory area capable of storing
     eight motion picture characters to be displayed on the next line, and, in
     the buffer memory 16, for each motion picture character, a horizontal
     position area (8 bits) 16-1, an attribute area (3 bits) 16-2 and a pair of
     shift registers (8 bits) 16-3 are allocated. The horizontal position area
     16-1 stores a horizontal position data supplied from the temporary memory
     15, and this area is structured in the form of a down-counter which
     down-counts in accordance with the scanning along a horizontal scanning
     line, and when the count has reached "0", the motion picture character is
     supplied as its output. The attribute area 16-2 stores a bit for
     determining the priority and two bits of color data and thus three bits in
     total among the attribute data stored in the temporary memory 15. Each of
     the shift registers 16-3 stores 8-bit data supplied as an output from the
     motion picture character pattern generator 12-1 in accordance with the
     character number of motion picture character in the temporary memory 15.
     The reason why a pair of shift registers 16-3 are provided in parallel is
     that a picture element is represented by two bits.
<BR><BR>In FIG. 5 is also provided a picture address register 21 which retrieves
     the character pattern generator 12-1 or 12-3 from terminals AD.sub.0-7
     through buses by means of motion picture character data, which has been
     found to be in-range, during the horizontal blanking period and of still
     picture character data during the line scanning period and calls or
     obtains corresponding character pattern data. In case where a vertical
     inversion data is contained in the motion picture character data, the
     retrieving operation is carried out with the vertical address inverted
     within the motion picture character pattern in accordance with a signal
     supplied from an inverter 22. There is also provided a horizontal inverter
     23 which functions to supply the retrieved motion picture character
     pattern data with the order of transmission reversed to the shift register
     16-3 of motion picture buffer memory 16 if a horizontal inversion signal
     is contained in the motion picture character data.
<BR><BR>Next, a description will be made as to the structure for displaying a still
     picture (background) character pattern. As line scanning proceeds, still
     picture character pattern data of the corresponding position is supplied
     through the terminals AD.sub.0-7 in accordance with a signal from the
     picture address register 21. This character pattern data is comprised of a
     two bit data for character pattern and another two bit data for color
     display for a single dot on the display screen, so that the character
     pattern data and color display data are inputted to the shift registers
     24-1, 24-2 and a selector 25, respectively, which are then inputted to
     selectors 28-1, 28-2 and 29 in the form of 8, 8 and 16 bits through shift
     registers 26-1, 26-2 and 27, respectively. In the case where no scrolling
     operation is to take place, these data are then outputted to a multiplexer
     30 in the order mentioned without change.
<BR><BR>The structure of FIG. 5 also includes a register 31 which has a dual
     function as a horizontal scroll register (SCCH) and as a video memory
     address register (VRAM.ARL) for counting the lower address of video memory
     and another register 32 having a dual function as a vertical scroll
     register (SCCV) and as a video memory address register (VRAM.ARH) for
     counting the upper address of video memory. In the scroll registers 31 and
     32 are set offset values (scrolling initiation position) at the time of
     scrolling in the order of that in the horizontal direction and that in the
     vertical direction, and the selection of selectors 28-1, 28-2 and 29 is
     carried out in accordance with these offset values. On the other hand,
     when used as video memory address registers 31 and 32, upon completion of
     read out/write in operation of video memory 12, values of 1 and 32 are
     respectively added automatically. Also provided as connected to the
     registers 31 and 32 are horizontal and vertical counters 33 and 34,
     respectively.
<BR><BR>The multiplexer 30 constitutes part of the synthesizer 17 shown in FIG. 3
     and it receives motion picture character pattern data and still picture
     character pattern data and moreover another motion picture character
     pattern data and still picture character pattern data from terminals
     EXT.sub.0-3, as the case may be. The multiplexer 30 then supplies its
     output signal to a color generator 35 in accordance with the priority
     order determined by the attribute data within the motion picture character
     pattern data. If desired, the multiplexer 30 may so function to supply its
     output signal to the exterior through the terminals EXT.sub.0-3. In the
     case where a collision occurs between a particular motion picture
     character pattern data and a still picture character pattern data in the
     multiplexer 30, a flag (STK.F) for that effect is raised.
<BR><BR>The color generator 35 is typically comprised of a RAM and it is accessed
     by a 6-bit code comprised of a 2-bit code designating one of four levels
     and a 4-bit code designating one of 12 kinds of phases (hue), so that
     selection is made by a 4-bit data representing a character pattern data
     supplied as an output from the multiplexer 30. A decoder 36 is provided as
     connected to receive an output signal from the color generator 35 as its
     input thereby converting it into a level selection signal and a phase
     selection signal. Also provided as connected to receive an output signal
     from the decoder as its input is a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 37
     which serves to have its input converted into and supplies as its output
     an analog video signal. A phase shifter 38 is provided as connected to the
     decoder 36.
<BR><BR>It is to be understood that the synthesizer 17 of FIG. 3 is constructed by
     those elements of multiplexer 30, color generator 35, decoder 36, DAC 37
     and phase shifter 38. Also provided are control registers 39 and 40 for
     determining the operating mode of PPU 11 and they receive data from CPU 3
     via a counter 41.
<BR><BR>FIG. 7 shows in detail the structure of multiplexer 30. As shown, the
     multiplexer 30 includes a transmission gate 50 for transmitting a 4-bit
     still picture character pattern data (BG0-BG3) and it includes four MOS
     transistors 50-1 through 50-4 each corresponding to each bit. Also
     provided is another transmission gate 51 for transmitting a 4-bit portion
     (OBJ0-OBJ3) among a 5-bit motion picture character pattern and it is
     provided with four MOS transistors 51-1 through 51-4 one for each bit.
     Provided in the multiplexer 30 is a priority determining circuit 52 for
     determining to transmit either one of the still picture character pattern
     data BG0-BG3 forming a background of displayed picture and the motion
     picture character pattern data OBJ0-OBJ3 and it is so structured that a
     NOR circuit 53 receives OBJ0 and OBJ1 as its two inputs and an OR circuit
     54 receives BG0 and BG1 as its two inputs. Data OBJ4 which determines the
     priority order and an output from the OR circuit 54 are supplied as two
     inputs to an AND circuit 55 whose output is supplied as one input to
     another OR circuit 56 which also receives as its the other input an output
     from the NOR circuit 53. The OR circuit 56 is connected to supply its
     output to the gate of each of the MOS transistors 50-1 through 50-4 and to
     supply its inverted output to the gates of MOS transistors 51-1 through
     51-4 via an inverter 57.
<BR><BR>As a result, depending upon a combination of BG0, BG1, OBJ0, OBJ1 and OBJ4,
     either one of the transmission gates 50 and 51 is turned on, so that
     BG0-BG3 or OBJ0-OBJ3 and the output signal from the inverter 57 indicating
     the result of the priority order determination are transferred through
     inverters 61-1 through 61-4 and 62-1 through 62-5 via transmission gate
     transistors 59-1 through 59-5, which are turned on and off in accordance
     with a clock signal .phi..
<BR><BR>Turn-over circuits 64-1 through 64-4 are also provided and they are
     appropriately activated by a slave signal SLAVE to thereby cause the
     terminals EXT0-EXT3 to function either as input or output terminals when
     two PPUs are connected to each other. The turn-over circuit 64-1 includes
     a driver circuit 65 which receives as its input either of data BG0 or OBJ0
     and which also receives the SLAVE signal for controlling the passage of
     data therethrough. Moreover, in order to control data input via the
     terminal EXT0, the turn-over circuit 64-1 includes a NAND circuit 66 which
     has one input connected to receive the data supplied via the terminal EXT0
     through an inverter 67 and the remaining input connected to receive the
     SLAVE signal via another inverter 68. The other turn-over circuits 64-2
     through 64-4 are similarly structured.
<BR><BR>Also provided is a master/slave priority order determining circuit 80 which
     causes a transmission gate 81 or 82 to be turned on in accordance with the
     SLAVE signal and input signals from BG0, BG1 (or OBJ0, OBJ1) and EXT0,
     EXT1 terminals, thereby determining to transfer the data from either one
     of the master and slave PPUs. BG0 and BG1 (or OBJ0 and OBJ1) are supplied
     as inputs to an OR circuit 85 and the data supplied through the EXT0 and
     EXT1 terminals are inputted to a NOR circuit 86. The circuit 80 includes
     another OR circuit 87 which has its one input connected to receive an
     output signal from the OR circuit 85 and the remaining input connected to
     receive an output signal from the NOR circuit 86 and the OR circuit 87 is
     connected to supply its output signal to the gate of each of MOS
     transistors provided in a transmission gate 81 and to supply its inverted
     output signal to the gate of each of MOS transistors in another
     transmission gate 82 via an inverter 88.
<BR><BR>The data transferred through the transmission gate 81 or 82 then passes
     through inverters 96-1 through 96-4 and transmission gate MOS transistors
     94-1 through 94-4 which are controlled by a clock signal .phi. and
     inverters 97-1 through 97-4 to be supplied as address signals CGA0-CGA3
     for addressing the color generator 35 shown in FIG. 5. As a signal CGA4
     which indicates whether CGA0-CGA3 are either BG0-BG3 or OBJ0-OBJ3, an
     output signal supplied from the priority determining circuit 52 is used
     after having been inverted by an inverter 94-5.
<BR><BR>There is also provided an AND circuit 100 which functions to raise a
     collision flag (STK.F) when a collision has occurred between BG0-BG3 and
     OBJ0-OBJ3.
<BR><BR>The operation of priority order determining circuit 52 of the multiplexer
     30 shown in FIG. 7 may be summarized in the following table.

<BR><BR>Next, in the case where two PPUs are provided as connected to each other
     and the present PPU serves as a master, the SLAVE signal is "1". In the
     turn-over circuits 64-1 through 64-4, the NAND circuit 66 receives at its
     one input "0" through the inverter 68, so that the NAND circuit 66 is
     enabled thereby allowing data to be inputted through the terminals
     EXT0-EXT3. On the other hand, the driver circuit 65 is disabled since the
     SLAVE signal is "1", thereby inhibiting data to be outputted. Conversely,
     in the case where the present PPU serves as a slave, the SLAVE signal is
     "0" so that the NAND circuit 66 becomes disabled and the driver circuit 65
     becomes enabled, thereby setting up the condition in which data may be
     outputted through terminals EXT0-EXT3.

<BR><BR>Now, the color generator 35, decoder 36, DAC 37 and phase shifter 38 will
     be described in detail with particular reference to FIG. 8.
<BR><BR>The color generator 35 is comprised of a RAM and capable of storing
     thirty-two 6-bit color codes, one of which is supplied as its output after
     having been selected by a 5-bit address signal CGA0-CGA4 supplied from the
     multiplexer 30. The color code signals stored in the color generator 35
     may be rewritten under the control of a CPU 112.
<BR><BR>Provided in the structure of FIG. 8 is a phase shifter 38 which divides six
     times (3.58 MHz.times.6) of the frequency of chrominance subcarrier (Sc)
     and produces twelve kinds of chrominance subcarriers different in phase
     from each other. Provided as connected to receive an output signal from
     the phase shifter 38 is a phase selector 114 which receives a 4-bit data
     among a 6-bit color code signal supplied from the color code generator 35
     thereby selectively outputting one of the twelve kinds of chrominance
     subcarriers different in phase supplied from the phase shifter 38, There
     is also provided a level decoder 115 which receives a 2-bit data among a
     6-bit color code signal supplied from the color generator 35 and converts
     it into a level selection signal having four different levels. It is to be
     noted that the decoder 38 of FIG. 5 includes the phase shifter 114 and the
     level decoder 115.
<BR><BR>Also provided as shown in FIG. 8 is a resistor ladder 116 which includes
     nine resistors 117-1 through 117-9 connected in series between a supply
     voltage V.sub.CC and ground (GND). From each of the nodes between the
     adjacent resistors, an output signal having a voltage level divided
     proportionately may be obtained through the corresponding one of MOS
     transistors 118-1 through 118-8 which together form a transmission gate.
     Gate circuits 119-1 and 119-4 are provided as appropriately connected to
     control two of the transistors 118-1 through 118-8 at the same time. Each
     of the gate circuits 119-1 through 119-4 includes two NAND circuits 120
     and 121, each of which has its one input connected to receive the same
     level selection signal supplied from the level decoder 115. Furthermore,
     in each of the gate circuits 119-1 through 119-4, one 120 of the pair of
     NAND circuits has the other input commonly connected to receive the same
     chrominance subcarrier signal having a desired phase supplied from the
     phase selector 114; whereas, the other NAND circuit 121 has its the other
     input connected to receive an output signal of the one NAND circuit 120.
     Each of the NAND circuits 120 and 121 has its output connected to the gate
     of corresponding one of MOS transistors 118-1 through 118-8. It is to be
     noted that the DAC 37 of FIG. 5 includes the resistor ladder 116,
     transistors 118-1 through 118-8 and gate circuits 119-1 through 119-4.
<BR><BR>The operation of the structure shown in FIG. 8 will now be described with
     particular reference to FIG. 9. When a single data is outputted from the
     multiplexer 30, there is outputted a single color code signal (6 bits)
     from the color generator 35. The phase selector 114 then receives only
     four bits among the thus supplied color code signal thereby selecting one
     out of twelve kinds of chrominance subcarriers different in phase one from
     another to be supplied to all of the gate circuits 119-1 through 119-4. On
     the other hand, the level decoder 115 receives a 2-bit data from the same
     color code signal to supply a level selection signal to one of the gate
     circuits 119-1 through 119-4.
<BR><BR>Now, suppose that, for example, the gate circuit 119-1 is selected by the
     level decoder 115, then a low level signal is applied to one input of each
     of the NAND circuits 120 and 121 in the gate circuit 119-1 and a high
     level signal is applied to one input of each of the NAND circuits 120 and
     121 in each of the remaining gate circuits 119-2 through 119-4. Under the
     condition, if the chrominance subcarrier signal from the phase selector
     114 is a low level signal, in the gate circuit 119-1, the NAND circuit 120
     supplies a high level output signal and the NAND circuit 121 supplies a
     low level output signal, so that the transistor 118-1 connected to the
     node of the resistor ladder at voltage V.sub.1 is turned on and the turned
     off. On the other hand, if the chrominance subcarrier signal is a high
     level signal, then the NAND circuits 120 and 121 of gate circuit 119-1
     supply low and high level signals, respectively, and, thus, the transistor
     118-1 connected to the node at voltage V.sub.1 is turned off and the
     transistor 118-2 connected to the node at voltage V.sub.2 is turned on.
     Under the circumstances, the outputs from all of the other gate circuits
     119-2 through 119-4 are at low level, and, thus, the transistors 118-3 and
     118-8 are all maintained off.
<BR><BR>As a result, an output signal obtained from the output terminal 22 under
     the condition is a color signal which is defined by a chrominance
     subcarrier having an intended phase and an amplitude which varies between
     two voltage levels V.sub.1 and V.sub.2 in an oscillatory manner, as
     indicated by a signal A in FIG. 9, whereby the center of amplitude
     indicates luminance or degree of brightness. In this color signal, the
     amplitude indicates chroma and the phase indicates hue.
<BR><BR>When another level is selected by the decoder 115 in accordance with
     another output signal from the multiplexer 30, for example when the gate
     119-2 is selected, there is outputted a color signal having an amplitude
     which varies between two voltage levels V.sub.3 and V.sub.4 as shown by a
     signal B in FIG. 9. Similarly, color signals for other color code levels
     are shown by signals C and D in FIG. 9.
<BR><BR>If another chrominance subcarrier having a different phase has been
     selected in accordance with a 4-bit code for phase selection in the color
     code signal supplied from the color generator 35, another color signal
     having a different phase (hue) with one of the signals A through D in FIG.
     9 having particular amplitudes (chroma) and voltage levels (luminance) is
     outputted. A color signal thus supplied as an output is then added with a
     burst signal and a sync signal to be formed into a color video signal
     which may be supplied to any of conventional T.V. sets (not shown) for
     display on the screen.
<BR><BR>Since each of the twelve different kinds of chrominance subcarriers can
     take four different levels (amplitudes and voltage levels) in the present
     embodiment, color may be produced in 48 different representations.
     However, since the output signal from the multiplexer 30 has a 5-bit
     structure, color may be produced in 32 different representations at a
     time. In view of this, provision is made of the color generator 11 capable
     of storing thirty-two 6-bit color codes in the present embodiment so that
     although only thirty-two kinds may be selected by the color data generator
     10, color may be represented in forty-eight different ways at maximum with
     a 6-bit color code signal by rewriting the contents of the color generator
     35 by CPU 112. Thus, the maximum number of different color representations
     in the present embodiment is 48, and four of the remaining codes may be
     allocated to white, gray (2) and black.
<BR><BR>FIG. 10 shows another embodiment of the present invention in which two PPUs
     11-1 and 11-2 are coupled together to synthesize the character patterns in
     these PPUs 11-1 and 11-2. Let us assume that use is made of the SLAVE
     signal and PPUs 11-1 and 11-2 function as a master and a slave,
     respectively. With PPUs 11-1 and 11-2 interconnected as shown in FIG. 10,
     a square wave having sharp rising and falling edges is applied to a clock
     terminal CLK and a reset signal is employed for initial synchronization
     between the two PPUs 11-1 and 11-2. Under the condition, the character
     pattern data of slave PPU 11-2 is outputted from terminals EXT0-3 to be
     inputted to the terminals EXT0-3 of master PPU 11-1, whereby
     synthesization of character pattern data takes place within the master PPU
     11-1 with the determination of priority order as described with reference
     to FIG. 7.
<BR><BR>With the structure shown in FIG. 10, as a video output signal, any of
     possible combinations between still or motion picture character pattern in
     master PPU 11-1 and still or motion picture character pattern in slave PPU
     11-2 may be obtained and displayed on the screen.
<BR><BR>As described in detail above, in accordance with the present invention,
     provision is made of a motion picture attribute table memory capable of
     storing information relating to a motion picture pattern for the next
     following frame during the vertical blanking period and a temporary memory
     for storing motion picture information to be displayed in the next
     following line, and, therefore, since the retrieval of motion picture
     attribute table memory can be done during the preceding line scanning
     operation, it is only necessary to retrieve the character pattern
     generator for those motion picture characters thus retrieved and found to
     be in-range during the horizontal blanking period. As a result, without
     requiring an increase in the number of connection pins, the number and
     kinds of motion picture character patterns which may be called or accessed
     during the horizontal blanking period can be increased.
<BR><BR>While the above provides a full and complete disclosure of the preferred
     embodiments of the present invention, various modifications, alternate
     constructions and equivalents may be employed without departing from the
     true spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the above description
     and illustration should not be construed as limiting the scope of the
     invention, which is defined by the appended claims.
