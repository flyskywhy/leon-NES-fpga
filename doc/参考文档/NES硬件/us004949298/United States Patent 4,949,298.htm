<font size="+1"> Memory cartridge having a multi-memory controller with memory bank
     switching capabilities and data processing apparatus
</font><BR>
<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A memory cartridge having a case and a printed circuit board housed in the
     case is connected, in use, to a data processing unit including a
     microprocessor and a picture processing unit. A memory cooperating with
     the data processing unit is installed on the printed circuit board, and an
     area of the memory is divided into a plurality of banks. A multi-memory
     controller installed on the printed circuit board includes a plurality of
     registers into which microprocessor generated data, representing bank
     switching conditions, are loaded. An address for switching the memory
     banks is output in response to the content of at least one of a plurality
     of registers. Thus, by changing the above-described data, the
     microprocessor can specify a specific bank at a specific time and utilize
     that bank.

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to a memory cartridge. More specifically, the
     present invention relates to a memory cartridge which can be attached to
     and detached from a data processing unit, such as in a video game
     apparatus connected to a conventional television receiver.
<BR><BR>2. Description of the Prior Art
<BR><BR>The following are examples of data processing units in which an image is
     displayed on a television receiver: a video game machine called "Family
     Computer" (trade mark) or "Nintendo Entertainment System" (trade mark),
     which is manufactured and sold by the applicant of the present invention
     and a personal computer called "MSX" (trade mark). These data processing
     units are enabled by receiving an external memory cartridge containing an
     educational or game software program that has been written in advance and
     stored in cartridge memory. A read-only memory (ROM) for storing program
     data and character data for display are contained in the memory cartridge.
<BR><BR>For memory cartridges used in the above-described manner, recently, memory
     size has been increased to a larger capacity, for example, 1M bits or 4M
     bits. In the case where such a large-capacity memory is employed, since
     address space accessible from a central processing unit in the data
     processing unit is limited, a so-called "bank switching" technique has
     been employed.
<BR><BR>U.S. Pat. No. 4,432,067 is a method for expanding memory capacity while the
     number of address lines, or the address space, connected to the data
     processing unit, is maintained at a predetermined number. U.S. Pat. No.
     4,432,067 discloses a memory cartridge having an address decoder, a latch
     circuit, a supplemental memory chip and a signal line for selecting a
     memory chip.
<BR><BR>In U.S. Pat. No. 4,432,067, the address decoder detects when the address
     data is a specific address that requires change-over (i.e., selection) of
     another memory chip. Then the memory chip is switched by the latch circuit
     and the signal line. This means that the change-over or switching of the
     memory chip is controlled by a dedicated hardware circuit and is performed
     only on a memory chip to memory chip basis. Therefore, it is impossible to
     switching a bank of an arbitrary memory size. Furthermore, since only that
     switching determined by the hardware circuit can be executed, there are
     many restrictions in designing a computer game or other program.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Therefore, the principal object of the present invention is to provide a
     memory cartridge allowing bank switching of a memory of an arbitrary
     memory size.
<BR><BR>Another object of the present invention is to provide a memory cartridge
     capable of switching banks based on a program of a data processing unit.
     The degree of freedom of program design will thus be increased.
<BR><BR>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a memory
     cartridge capable of increasing the functions of an external memory.
<BR><BR>To be brief, a memory cartridge in accordance with the present invention is
     attachable to and detachable from a data processing unit that includes a
     microprocessor. The memory cartridge is loaded in the data processing unit
     when used and comprises a printed circuit board connected to the data
     processing unit when loaded therein, a memory installed on the printed
     circuit board and having its memory area divided into a plurality of
     banks, and memory controlling means which is also installed on the printed
     circuit board. The memory controlling means receives data representing
     bank switching conditions given from the microprocessor and provides an
     address that specifies a bank to the memory. The memory controlling means
     includes a plurality of registers to which the data from said
     microprocessor is provided, and address generating means for generating
     said address based on the data of the registers.
<BR><BR>When the memory cartridge is loaded in the data processing unit, the
     printed circuit board is connected to the data processing unit, and the
     system comprising the memory cartridge and the data processing unit is
     enabled. The data representing bank switching conditions is sent from the
     microprocessor of the data processing unit to the memory cartridge. Based
     on this data, the memory controlling means sends to the memory an address
     corresponding to the bank to be selected. Accordingly, the selected bank
     of the memory is directly accessed from the microprocessor of the data
     processing unit.
<BR><BR>In accordance with the present invention, the memory controlling means
     provides the address for bank switching of the memory based on the data
     from the microprocessor of the data processing unit. Therefore, any bank
     of the memory can be selectively enabled by changing the data from the
     microprocessor. By having the microprocessor change the data based on the
     progress of the program step, the bank switching of the memory can be
     executed according to the program. For that reason, the memory cartridge
     in accordance with the present invention can improve the degree of freedom
     in designing or using the program when compared with the conventional
     memory cartridge in which the bank change-over is effected by a hardware
     circuit.
<BR><BR>These objects and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the
     present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed
     description of the embodiments of the present invention when taken in
     conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>In reference to FIG. 1, a memory cartridge 10 of this embodiment includes a
     case 12 formed by an upper case 12a and a lower case 12b. The case 12 is
     formed nearly in a rectangle, and a protrusion 12c is formed at one side
     thereof. An opening 12d is formed by the protrusion 12c and the other
     sides of the case 12 are blocked by side walls.
<BR><BR>A printed circuit board 14 and a power supply 16 are housed in the case 12.
     A protrusion 14a is formed at the portion of the printed circuit board 14
     corresponding to the protrusion 12c of the above-described case 12. The
     protrusion 14a of the printed circuit board 14 is exposed through the
     opening 12d of the case 12. Then, on the protrusion 14a, conductive
     patterns, or connecting electrodes 18a-18n constituting connecting means
     to an edge connector 32 (FIG. 2) of a game machine main unit 30 are formed
     so as to be distributed in the direction that the side of the protrusion
     14a extends.
<BR><BR>A program memory 20 composed of a non-volatile semiconductor memory, for
     example ROM or EEPROM, is mounted on the main surface of the printed
     circuit board 14. The program memory 20 has a memory area of, for example,
     4M bits, wherein program data required for the execution of a
     predetermined operation of a central processing unit (CPU) 34 (FIG. 2)
     included in the game machine main unit 30 is stored in advance. Also, a
     character memory 22 consisting of a similar non-volatile semiconductor
     memory is installed on the printed circuit board 14. The character memory
     22 has a memory area of, for example, 4M bits, wherein data (character
     data) relating to game characters or the like is stored in advance. An
     expansion memory 24 is installed on the printed circuit board 14, and the
     expansion memory 24 can be utilized where the capacity of the program
     memory 20 is inadequate. The expansion memory 24 may be a RAM having a
     capacity of, for example, 64K bits.
<BR><BR>A multi-memory controller (MMC) 26 constituting one of the features of this
     embodiment is installed on the printed circuit board 14. The MMC 26
     receives data from the CPU 34 and a PPU 42 of the game machine main unit
     30. The MMC 26 is used to switch banks of the program memory 20 and/or the
     character memory 22.
<BR><BR>The aforementioned power supply 16 installed in the case 12 is utilized for
     back-up of the above-described expansion memory 24. For the power supply
     16, the primary battery can be a lithium battery or alkaline battery and
     the secondary battery, which can be charged, can be a nickel-cadmium
     battery or an electrostatic capacitor such as an electric double-layer
     capacitor.
<BR><BR>In addition, the above-described character memory 22 may be a RAM as does
     the expansion memory 24. A power supply for back-up will then have to be
     provided as in the expansion memory 24.
<BR><BR>The present invention is applicable to a memory cartridge in which a casing
     and a printed circuit board are united form a compact, thin card-like
     memory, such as an IC card.
<BR><BR>The game machine main unit 30, one example of the data processing unit for
     which the cartridge of the embodiment can be utilized, is shown in FIG. 2.
     The electrodes 18a-18n of the cartridge 10 are inserted into an edge
     connector 32 of the main unit 30, to thereby electrically connect the
     cartridge 10 and main unit 30, thus forming one system.
<BR><BR>The game machine main unit 30 includes the eight-bit microprocessor (CPU)
     34, for example, the integrated circuit "2A03" manufactured by Nintendo.
     Game controllers 40a and 40b are connected to the CPU 34 through an I/O
     interface 38.
<BR><BR>Furthermore, a working RAM (W-RAM) 36, a PPU 42 (picture processing unit),
     a video RAM (V-RAM) 44, and an RF modulator 46 are installed in the main
     unit 30. For the PPU 42, for example, the integrated circuit "2C02"
     manufactured by Nintendo is used. The PPU 42 reads data of the character
     memory 22 and the V-RAM 44 under the control of the CPU 34, converts the
     same into video signals and sends these signals, to the RF modulator 46.
     The RF modulator 46 modulates the video signal, outputting a television
     signal of, for example, NTSC standard to the television receiver.
<BR><BR>In reference to FIG. 3, detailed description is made of a configuration of
     the memory cartridge 10 as illustrated in FIG. 1, which is loaded in the
     edge connector 32 of the main unit 30 as shown in FIG. 2. As described
     above, the memory cartridge 10 is connected to the edge connector 32 and
     is provided with data or signals from the CPU 34 and the PPU 42 of the
     game machine main unit 30 through the edge connector 32.
<BR><BR>The program memory 20 receives program addresses A0-A13 from the CPU 34
     (FIG. 2) and receives eight-bit data through the edge connector 32. A
     program address A14 from the CPU 34 is sent to the MMC 26 along with the
     program address A13. The character memory 22 is provided with character
     addresses A0-A11 from the PPU 42, and a character address A12 is provided
     to the MMC 26 along with the character addresses A10 and A11. Then,
     eight-bit data is sent to the character memory 22 from the PPU 42. The
     program addresses A0-A12 and eight-bit data are also provided to the
     expansion memory 24 likewise as well as the program memory 20.
<BR><BR>To the MMC 26, a system clock .phi.2 is provided from the CPU 34 and also a
     signal ROMSEL.sub.1 specifying addresses 8000H-FFFFH of the program memory
     20 is also provided. Also, a read/write signal R/W is sent to the MMC 26
     from the CPU 34. The read/write signal R/W is also sent to the
     above-described expansion memory 24.
<BR><BR>As described in detail later, a signal RAMSEL for enabling the expansion
     memory 24 is sent to the expansion memory 24 from the MMC 26. In the case
     where the expansion memory 24 is a 64 K-bit RAM located on two chips a
     chip select signal RAM1 is also sent to the expansion memory 24 from the
     MMC 26. Furthermore, the MMC 26 outputs a signal ROMSEL0 for enabling the
     program memory 20. Also, the MMC 26 acts as a controlling means for bank
     switching of the program memory 20 and the character memory 22. Therefore,
     from the MMC 26 four-bit program addresses PRA14-PRA17 are sent to the
     program memory 20 and five-bit character addresses CRA12-CRA16 are sent to
     the character memory 22.
<BR><BR>The negative electrode of the power supply 16 included in the memory
     cartridge 10 is grounded, and the positive electrode is connected to a
     power terminal Vcc of the edge connector 32 through a forward-direction
     diode 50 and a reverse-direction diode 52 connected to the diode 50. A
     power supply from the game machine main unit 30 is applied to this power
     terminal Vcc. The output of the diode 50 is connected to a chip select
     terminal CS of the expansion memory 24 through a resistor that is also
     connected to the collector of a transistor 54. The emitter of the
     transistor 54 is grounded, and the above-described signal RAMSEL from the
     MMC 26 is sent to the transistor 54 base. The output of the other diode 52
     is connected to the power supply Vcc of the expansion memory 24.
<BR><BR>In the case where the memory cartridge 10 is loaded in the game machine
     main unit 30 through the edge connector 32, the voltage Vcc is supplied to
     the expansion memory 24 through the diode 52. When the memory cartridge 10
     is removed from the edge connector 32, or even if loaded, when a power
     switch 48 of the game machine main unit 30 is turned off, the voltage Vcc
     is sent from the power supply 16 to the expansion memory 24 through the
     diode 50. Thus, the diode 50 acts as both a switch applying a voltage to
     the expansion memory 24 and as a reverse flow blocking diode preventing
     the current from the game machine main unit 30 from flowing into the power
     supply 16.
<BR><BR>In reference to FIG. 4 through FIG. 6, further detailed description is made
     on the MMC 26 included in the memory cartridge 10. As shown in FIG. 4, the
     MMC 26 is one custom IC. Terminals No. 1-No. 11 and No. 16 are used as
     output terminals, and terminals No. 13-No. 15 and No. 17-No. 23 are used
     as input terminals. Terminal No. 12 is connected to a ground potential GND
     and terminal 24 is connected to the voltage Vcc.
<BR><BR>To be detailed, terminals No. 1-No. 4 are utilized as output terminals of
     the four-bit program addresses PRA14-PRA17, and terminal No. 4 is
     sometimes utilized as an output terminal of the chip select signal RAM1 of
     the expansion memory 24. In the case where a one-chip memory is used as
     the expansion memory 24 (FIG. 3), the signal RAM1 has no meaning, but acts
     as a one-bit chip select signal when two memory chips are mounted, it
     selects either of the chips by "1" or "0".
<BR><BR>Terminal No. 5 is an output terminal for the signal ROMSEL0 sent to the
     above-described program memory 20, and only when the program memory 20 is
     read, that is, only when the read/write signal R/W from the CPU 34 is
     high, is it outputted as a low-level signal.
<BR><BR>Terminal No. 6 is an output terminal for the signal RAMSEL sent to the
     above-described transistor 54, which specifies addresses 6000H-7FFFH of
     the expansion memory 24.
<BR><BR>Terminals No. 7-No. 11 are output terminals of addresses for bank switching
     of the character memory 22, that is, the character addresses CRA12-CRA16.
<BR><BR>Terminals No. 13-No. 15 are input terminals of addresses PA10-PA12 from the
     PPU 42.
<BR><BR>Terminal No. 16 is an output terminal of signal VRAM10 sent to the tenth
     address bit of the address of the V-RAM 44. Signal VRAM 10 is utilized for
     specifying the memory area accessible by the PPU 42 in the V-RAM 44 and
     controlling make or break of scrolling.
<BR><BR>The read/write signal R/W from the CPU 34 is sent to terminal No. 17,
     one-bit serial data is sent to terminal No. 18 from the CPU 34, and
     one-bit data clear signal, that is, a synchronizing timing signal of the
     above-described serial data, is sent to terminal No. 19.
<BR><BR>The signal ROMSEL1 which specifies addresses 8000H-FFFFH for the program
     memory 20 is sent to terminal No. 20 from the CPU 34.
<BR><BR>Then, the program addresses A13 and A14 from the CPU 34 are sent to the
     terminals No. 21 and No. 22. The system clock .phi.2 is sent to the
     terminal No. 23.
<BR><BR>As shown in FIG. 5 installed in the MMC 26 is, an SP register 56 that
     receives serial data from the CPU 34 which is sent to the above-described
     terminal No. 18. As shown in FIG. 6, the SP register 56 is as a seven-bit
     shift register, and the most significant two bits thereof are coupled to a
     decoder 58. Also, the MMC 26 includes a timing generator 60 which receives
     the signals ROMSEL1, R/W, the data clear signal, and the system clock
     .phi.2. Based on the signal ROMSEL1 and the signal R/W, the timing
     generator 60 outputs the low-level signal ROMSEL0 when the former is low
     and the latter high, and also sends a shift clock SCLK to the SP register
     56 from an AND gate 60a (FIG. 6) in response to the system clock .phi.2.
     The shift clock is counted by a counter 60b (FIG. 6) included in the
     timing generator 60. The timing generator 60 sends a data set enabling
     signal DSE to the decoder 58 at the seventh clock signal after the data
     clear signal has been given, that is, at the point when all the seven-bit
     serial data from the CPU 34 is loaded in the SP register 56.
<BR><BR>The decoder 58 receives the most significant two bits of the data from the
     SP register 56, decodes this data and sends a data set signal to any one
     of a first register 62, a second register 64, a third register 66 and a
     fourth register 68. Accordingly, the above-described SP register 56 and
     decoder 56 constitute a data multiplexer.
<BR><BR>These registers 62-68 are all five-bit registers, and when given the data
     set signal by the decoder 58 they load the remaining five-bit data of the
     SP register 56. The contents of these registers 62-68 are used as memory
     control data for the program memory 20, the character memory 22 or the
     V-RAM 44, as for example, a bank specifying code.
<BR><BR>A character bank control portion 70 receives five-bit data from the first
     register 62 and the second register 64, also receiving the least
     significant one bit from the third register 66. The address PA12 from the
     PPU 42 (FIG. 2), which is sent through the edge connector 32 (FIG. 3), is
     also sent to the character bank control portion 70. The character bank
     control portion 70 includes a large number of gates, as shown in FIG. 6,
     and outputs the character addresses CRA12-CRA16 for bank switching of the
     character memory 22 by the processing by the gates.
<BR><BR>A V-RAM control portion 72 receives two-bit data from the third register
     66, receives the addresses PA10 and PA11 from the PPU 42, and outputs the
     address signal VRAM10 of the V-RAM 44 according to the gate processing of
     a large number of gates, as shown in FIG. 6.
<BR><BR>A program bank control portion 74 receives the most significant two bits of
     the third register 66 and five-bit data of the fourth register 68,
     receives the program address A14 which is given from the CPU 34, and
     outputs the program addresses PRA14-PRA17 for bank switching of the
     program memory 20 according to the gate processing of a large number of
     gates, as shown in FIG. 6.
<BR><BR>Furthermore, a decoder 76 is, if necessary, installed in the MMC 26. The
     program addresses A13 and A14 from the CPU 34, the system clock .phi.2,
     and the signal RAMSEL1 are given to the MMC 26. As shown in FIG. 6, the
     decoder 76 composed of a four-input AND gate, outputs the signal RAMSEL
     for activating the expansion memory 24 in response to a formation of
     predetermined conditions.
<BR><BR>As described above, the CPU 34 is an eight-bit microcomputer, and the
     address space accessible by the CPU 34 is thus addresses 0000H-FFFFH
     represented by 2.sup.16, as shown in FIG. 7A. Among them, the addresses
     0000H-6000H are utilized as the W-RAM 36, as shown in FIG. 2, or another
     register area. Also, the addresses 6000H-7FFFH among addresses 6000H-8000H
     are utilized as address space for access to the expansion memory 24 (FIG.
     3), and the addresses 8000H-FFFFH are utilized as address space for access
     to one bank (256K bits=32K bytes) of the program memory 20. Accordingly,
     in the case where the program memory 20 has a memory capacity of 4M bits
     (512K Byte), there are sixteen (16) banks of memory area which are
     addressed as address 8000H-FFFFH. These banks are switched by the MMC 26
     as described later.
<BR><BR>Also, in the PPU 42, as shown in FIG. 8, addresses 0000H-2000H are utilized
     as addresses for access to one bank (64K bits) of the character memory 22.
<BR><BR>This means that in this embodiment, the program memory 20 of 4M bits is
     divided into 16 banks of 256K bits each, and these 16 banks are switched
     by the program bank control portion 74 (FIG. 5). Likewise, the character
     memory 22 of 1M bits is divided into 16 banks of 64K bits each, and these
     16 banks are switched by the character bank control portion 70.
<BR><BR>Also, the V-RAM 44 (FIG. 4) accessed by the PPU 42 has a memory area of 4K
     bytes as shown in FIG. 9. However, in practice, only 2K bytes are employed
     as the V-RAM 44. Accordingly, when scrolling occurs on a CRT as an image
     displaying means (not illustrated), the addresses of the V-RAM 44
     accessible by these 2K bytes must be switched. This change-over of
     addresses is performed by the V-RAM control portion 72. This means that,
     as shown in FIG. 6, the V-RAM control portion 72 includes two AND gates
     72a and 72b which receive the addresses PA10 and PA11 from the PPU 42,
     respectively. These AND gates 72a and 72b select which one of the PA10 and
     the PA11 is to be sent as the signal VRAM10 which is the tenth address bit
     of the V-RAM 44. By this selection, the manner in which the memory space
     of 2K bytes of the V-RAM 44 is to be accessed, that is, the manner in
     which the memory area should be arranged in the address space, is
     determined. The result is either V scrolling (when the PA10 is given to
     the VRAM10), H scrolling (when the PA11 is given to the VRAM10) or a state
     where no scrolling is performed.
<BR><BR>Then, when an AND gate 72c of the V-RAM control portion 74 is disabled by
     another bit output of the third register 66, the address PA10 or PA11 of
     the PPU 42 is not output as the signal VRAM10, and this signal VRAM10, the
     tenth address bit of the V-RAM 44, is then low at all times. Consequently,
     a memory area of the V-RAM 44 for only one screen, that is, 1K bytes, is
     made accessible by the PPU 42 independent of the address from the PPU 42.
<BR><BR>Next, description is provided of the bank switching of the program memory
     20 and bank switching of the character memory 22.
<BR><BR>To switch the banks of the program memory 20, serial data, whose most
     significant two bits are "11" and whose remaining five bits are a code
     specifying any one of 16 banks of the program memory 20, is sent to the
     terminal No. 18 of the MMC 26 from the CPU 34 through the edge connector
     32. Then, the seven-bit data is loaded in the SP register 56, and the
     signal DSE is outputted to the decoder 58 from the timing generator 60.
     The decoder 58 decodes two-bit data "11" of the SP register 56, sending
     the data set signal to the fourth register 68. The remaining five bits of
     the SP register 56 are then loaded in the fourth register 68. The bank
     selection code loaded in the fourth register 68 is given to the program
     bank control portion 74.
<BR><BR>The program bank control portion 74 outputs the addresses PRA14-PRA17 for
     bank switching of the program memory 20 when the most significant bit of
     five bits to be sent is "0", and outputs the signal RAM1, a chip select
     signal, to the expansion memory 24 from the terminal No. 4 when the most
     significant bit is "1". Accordingly, whether only the bank address of the
     program memory 20 is output from the program bank control portion 74, or a
     three-bit program address for bank switching and a one-bit change-over
     signal for the expansion memory 24 is output depends on whether "0" or "1"
     is the most significant one bit of the five-bit data loaded in the fourth
     register 68.
<BR><BR>When the four-bit program addresses PRA14-PRA17 are sent to the program
     memory 20 from the program bank control portion 74, any one of 16 banks of
     the program memory 20 is enabled selectively by the four-bit address.
     Then, only the enabled bank is accessible directly by the CPU 34. This
     means that by utilizing the address space of 8000H-FFFFH, the CPU 34
     accesses to that bank of the program memory 20.
<BR><BR>Thus, for the banks of the program memory 20, an arbitrary bank is selected
     by changing the serial data from the CPU 34. The bank switching of the
     program memory 20 can be executed by program, that is, by entering bank
     select data in advance in the program of the CPU 34. The same is true of
     the bank switching of the character memory 22 as described below.
<BR><BR>Next, an explanation follows where the expansion memory 24 is selected. The
     expansion memory 24 is utilized when the memory capacity (2K byte) of the
     W-RAM 36 in the main unit 30 is not sufficient. Address 6000H-7000H which
     is different from the address space (8000H-FFFFH) of the program memory 20
     is assigned to the address space of the expansion memory 24. The AND gate
     76 outputs the signal RAMSEL in a short time period when the AND condition
     is detected of the addresses A13 and A14, system clock .phi.2, and the
     inversion of the signal ROMSELI. In response to the signal RAMSEL, the
     transistor 54 is turned on, and the expansion memory 24 is selected. In
     this state, the CPU 34 sends the address data within the address space and
     the data to be written to the expansion memory 24 so as to write the data
     into the expansion memory 24, or reads the data from the expansion memory
     24. When the system clock .phi.2 reverses, the AND gate 76 stops the
     output of the signal RAMSEL, and the expansion memory 24 enters into a
     non-selected state. This means that the expansion memory 24 is selected
     within a short time period of the CPU 34 machine cycle and has no relation
     to the switching of the bank of the program memory 20. The data is thus
     written or read into or from the expansion memory 24 in real time. Thus,
     the address bus and the data bus of the program memory 20 can be used for
     the expansion memory (RAM) 24 without adding any address and data lines
     for CPU 34.
<BR><BR>In addition, if a backup power source 16 is provided association with the
     expansion memory 24, advanced game states such as a score and a stage
     number being advanced and the like stored in the expansion memory 24. The
     data representing the game state of the last game executed is maintained
     and the game can be continued even if the memory cartridge 10 is unloaded
     or the power switch is turned off.
<BR><BR>In addition, the program memory 20 may be switched as banks of 128K bits
     (=16 bytes) for example, each in place of the switching on a 256K bit bank
     basis. In such a case, the output the third register 66 designates that
     the program memory 20 is to be bank switching for each unit of 128K bits
     (=16K bytes). When the address A14 is "1", the address space C000H-BFFFH
     is specified as a home bank, and the address space 8000H-BFFFH is bank
     switching based on the output of the fourth register 68 (see the middle of
     FIG. 7B). On the other hand, when the address A14 is "0", the address
     space 8000H-C000H is specified as the home bank, and the address space
     C000H-FFFFH is bank switched by the output of the fourth register 68 (see
     the right of FIG. 7B). The home bank is an area where the program of the
     main routine and the like is stored. A system where the banks having 256K
     bits are switched is used in the case where the programs are switching and
     executed on the bank basis. By contrast, a system where the banks having
     128K bits are switched is used in the case where the game data (for
     example, the position of the character, data for specifying a kind of
     character) stored in such a bank is switched and utilized while the
     program of the home bank is executed. That is, the latter system is
     advantageous for executing an interrupt routine while the program of the
     home bank is executed, or the generating sound effects.
<BR><BR>Next, character memory 22 bank switching is described. The bank switching
     of the character memory 22 can be performed two ways; the switching on a
     64K bit bank basis or the bank switching on a 32K bit bank basis. This
     means that the character memory 22 may be switched as 16 banks or as 32
     banks. Such a switching of the bank size is performed by the least
     significant one bit of the third register 66, and the switching is made on
     a 64K bit bank basis when the least significant bit is "0", and on a 32K
     bit bank basis when the bit is "1".
<BR><BR>Then, when the least significant bit of the third register 66 is "1", the
     character bank control portion 70 selects one of 32 banks of the character
     memory 22 based on the bank specifying code of a total of 10 bits from the
     first register 62 and the second register 64. Also, when the least
     significant bit of the third register 66 is "0" the character bank control
     portion 70 selectively enables any one of 16 banks according to the
     content of the most significant four bits of the second register 64.
<BR><BR>Where the character memory 22 is switched on a 32K bit bank basis, the PPU
     42 uses the address space 0000H-0FFFH or 1000H-1FFFH. In the case where
     the switching is performed on a 64K bit bank basis, the PPU 42 uses the
     address space 0000H-1FFFFH.
<BR><BR>In addition, in the above-described embodiment, the program memory 20 and
     the character memory 22 may be constituted with separate memory chips,
     respectively. However, by constituting them both with the same ROM or RAM,
     they both may use different memory areas in the same memory chip.
<BR><BR>Furthermore, in the above-described embodiment, a one-chip memory having a
     large memory capacity is used as the program memory 20. However, a
     plurality of memory chips may be used if it is difficult to use such a
     large sized memory chip.
<BR><BR>Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in
     detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration
     and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit
     and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the
     appended claims.
