Any specific versions of the DirectX libraries/headers may be placed in this
directory, to ensure that nester is linked with them.

nester is linked to the DirectX 6 directsound library file, since tests
showed that nester's sound did not work in versions previous to 7 when
linked with the DirectX 7 directsound library file.
