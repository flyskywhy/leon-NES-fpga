nesterJ - NES Emulator for Win32

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"nesterJ" is based on "nester public beta 3" by Darren Ranalli.
It is added some functions.
It is also added many mappers from "Unofficial nester" written by Mr. Takeda.
Mr. Ranalli only knows these things; He do not know our details.
So you cannot ask him about "nesterJ".
